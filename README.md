Certificate verification

It is highly recommended to always use SSL certificate verification. By default, urllib3 does not verify HTTPS requests.

In order to enable verification you will need a set of root certificates. The easiest and most reliable method is to use the certifi package which provides Mozillaâ€™s root certificate bundle: can cause SSL warnings SNIMissingWarning and InsecurePlatformWarning

Solution: 

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
